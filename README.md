# e-commerce-backend

## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to get more familiar with backend development. Specifically, I was able to practice setting up models and routes. This application would be good for any business looking to track inventory. During this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to configure a working Express.js API and how to use Sequelize to interact with the SQL database.
